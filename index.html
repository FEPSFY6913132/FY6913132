      <pre>
        Alan Turing first developed the Imitation Game in hopes to answer the question, “Can machines think?” It was in 1950, that Turing officially 
        posed the question in his research paper, “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” however since then, many technological advances have been 
        made. This paper raises the question of where AI sits on the scale of intelligence. Through my analysis, it has shown that we first need to 
        define intelligence. Once we have this understanding, we can then evaluate behaviour and determine if it is ‘intelligent’. Presently, while 
        machines can perform ‘intelligent’ tasks, the process they use to come to execute them cannot necessarily be considered ‘thinking.’ However, 
        with the current trajectory of AI progress, the possibility of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) could change the way we perceive 
        intelligence.

    <!--- DISCUSSION --->
    <h3 id="Discussion"><b>Discussion</b></h3>
    <p class="ex1">
      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <pre>
        The Turing Test assesses a computer’s ability to behave indistinguishably from a human <a href="#(Mohn, 2023)" style="color:#000000;">(Mohn, 2023).</a> Turing predicted that by 2000, a computer 
        “would be able to play the Imitation Game so well that the average interrogator will not have more than a 70% chance of making the right 
        identification after 5 minutes of questioning.” It is 25 years later, and no computer has ever come close to achieving this <a href="#(Britannica, 2025)" style="color:#000000;">(Britannica, 2025).</a> 
        Does that speak to the intelligence of modern computers or to the relevance of the Test? Develops in artificial intelligence all seem to move 
        towards making it more human-like. If something acts like a sentient being, can it be considered sentient <a href="#(Britannica, 2025)" style="color:#000000;">(Britannica, 2025)</a>, even if that 
        something is a machine? 
      </pre>
      <h4>The Imitation Game</h4>
      <pre>
        The Imitation Game was originally a thought experiment, designed by Alan Turing <a href="#(Carnegie Mellon University, n.d.)" style="color:#000000;">(Carnegie Mellon University, n.d.).</a> It was laid out in his paper 
        ‘Computing Machinery and Intelligence’ in 1950. Originally, the basis of the experiment was a remote human interrogation with a fixed time frame 
        <a href="#(Britannica, 2025)" style="color:#000000;">(Britannica, 2025).</a> The same principles were then applied to a machine, where an interrogator must successfully distinguish between a man and a 
        computer based on their responses (Britannica, 2025). This adapted version is better known today, as the ‘Turing Test’ 
        <a href="#(Carnegie Mellon University, n.d.)" style="color:#000000;">(Carnegie Mellon University, n.d.).</a>
      </pre>
      <h4>The Turing Test in the world of advanced AI</h4>
      <br>
      <h5>The Gap between Imitation and Intelligence</h5>
      <pre>
        In their book ‘Automata Studies,’  Shannon and McCarthy recognised a weakness in the Test <a href="#(Shannon & McCarthy, 1956)" style="color:#000000;">(Shannon & McCarthy, 1956).</a> They called attention 
        to the fact that “it is possible, in principle, to design a machine with a complete set of arbitrarily chosen responses to all possible input 
        stimuli.” This means, a machine could ‘pass’ the Turing Test by simply looking up an appropriate response in an answer table, proving that a 
        system of no intelligence could pass the Test <a href="#(Copeland, 2025)" style="color:#000000;">(Copeland, 2025).</a> 

        At present, many of the leading Large Language Models (LLMs) are passing alternative intelligence tests. However, these models will have been 
        ’trained’ on vast amounts of data, meaning they may have developed pre-determined answers <a href="#(Rogoyski, 2024)" style="color:#000000;">(Rogoyski, 2024). </a>This makes it uncertain how accurate 
        these tests actually are, and this uncertainty will continue to grow with the advancement of AI. Epoch estimates that by 2028, AI models will 
        have ‘read’ everything ever written by humans and once this milestone has been reached, it will only become more difficult to assess the true 
        ‘intelligence’ of AI <a href="#(Rogoyski, 2024)" style="color:#000000;">(Rogoyski, 2024).</a> Therefore, if a machine of no intelligence can pass the test and equally, if an intelligent being can 
        fail the test, then how well is it functioning as a test of intelligence <a href="#(Copeland, 2025)" style="color:#000000;">(Copeland, 2025).</a> 
      </pre>
      <h5>Modern AI vs Intelligence Tests</h5>
      <pre> 
        Turing himself said that “a computer that ought to be described as intelligent might never the less fail the test if it were incapable of 
        successfully imitating a human being” <a href="#(Turing, 1950)" style="color:#000000;">(Turing, 1950).</a> This could be considered the case for ChatGPT, as, while it can perform intelligent 
        tasks, it would be unlikely to pass the Turing Test <a href="#(Copeland, 2025)" style="color:#000000;">(Copeland, 2025). </a>This is fundamentally down to the fact that ChatGPT was not developed 
        with passing the Test in mind. Alternative tests are being retired because of this reason, as AIs are doing so well at them <a href="#(Rogoyski, 2024)" style="color:#000000;">(Rogoyski, 2024).</a> 
        The chess-playing AI Stockfish is an example of this. Even with a higher Elo score then the highest scoring human player, Magnus Carlsen, 
        Stockfish is unable to understand language <a href="#(Rogoyski, 2024)" style="color:#000000;">(Rogoyski, 2024).</a> While Stockfish can perform an intelligent task and pass an ‘intelligence test’ 
        it still cannot be considered intelligent. Therefore, we cannot consider these extremely task-specific tests accurate intelligence tests, as 
        they only demonstrate a narrow measure of intelligence <a href="#(Rogoyski, 2024)" style="color:#000000;">(Rogoyski, 2024).</a> When tested one way, systems can breeze through the tasks that what 
        once were considered feats of machine intelligence. However tested another way, systems seem much less impressive <a href="#(Biever, 2023)" style="color:#000000;">(Biever, 2023).</a>
      </pre>
      <h4>The Future Trajectiry of AI</h4>
      <br>
      <h5>Artificial General Intelligence</h5>
      <pre>
        Arguably, the overall goal of AI development is to build machine that can ‘think’ <a href="#(Copeland, 2025)" style="color:#000000;">(Copeland, 2025).</a> The path to this goal is with Artificial 
        General Intelligence (AGI). AGI was introduced as an idea in 2007 by Goertzel and Pennachin in “Artificial General intelligence” <a href="#(Press, 2024)" style="color:#000000;">(Press, 2024).</a> 
        They define AGI as “AI systems that possess a reasonable degree of self- understanding and autonomous self-control and have the ability to solve a 
        variety of complex problems in a variety of contexts, and to learn to solve new problems that they didn’t know about at the time of their creation” 
        <a href="#(Goertzel, 2007)" style="color:#000000;">(Goertzel, 2007).</a> At present, it is uncertain how this can be achieved, however, back in 2007, Goertzel and Pennachin merely considered the whole 
        issue an engineering challenge <a href="#(Press, 2024)" style="color:#000000;">(Press, 2024) </a>and stated “we know that general intelligence is possible, in the sense that humans – particular 
        configurations of atoms – display it” <a href="#(Goertzel, 2007)" style="color:#000000;">(Goertzel, 2007).</a> 
      </pre>
      <h5>François Chollet's 'Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus' (ARC)</h5>
      <pre>
        French Google engineer, François Chollet, believes that true intelligence is the ability to adapt and learn in new and unseen situations 
        <a href="#(Chollet, 2019)" style="color:#000000;">(Chollet, 2019). </a>In 2019, he created his own test to measure intelligence which is a collection of puzzles in the form of simple visual grids 
        designed to test an AI’s ability to infer and apply abstract rules <a href="#(Rogoyski, 2024)" style="color:#000000;">(Rogoyski, 2024). </a>AI is forced to ‘work out’ the puzzle and cannot revise all 
        possible answers. So far, no system has come close, but there is a $600,000 reward for the first AI system to score 85% on the test 
        <a href="#(Rogoyski, 2024)" style="color:#000000;">(Rogoyski, 2024).</a>
      </pre>
      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <pre>
        In conclusion, its revealed that answering Turing’s seemingly simple question of “Can machines think?”, is much more complex. The question quickly 
        turns to a question of intelligence, which is hard enough to answer when considering humans. With the advancements in AI, it is apparent more 
        robust tests are needed (i.e. ARC). The main weakness in the Turing Test and many other intelligence tests is the narrow scope. It has been shown 
        that AI can be developed to specifically complete tasks to standards better than humans. However, with such explicit tasks, this does not necessarily 
        demonstrate truly intelligent behaviour. Nevertheless, while AI is still very task-specific, the Turing Test can still be considered relevant, but 
        this is likely to change with the progression of AGI.
